# Concurrent Rubic's Cube

This program allows you to create an $n$-sided Rubik's Cube and perform rotations on its sides. It supports concurrent execution in the sense that moves which can be performed in parallel (e.g., when two adjacent faces are rotated sequentially) are executed simultaneously.
